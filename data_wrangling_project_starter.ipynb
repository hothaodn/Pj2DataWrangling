    "Does Netflix prioritize movies with high ratings on MovieLens?\n",

    "How have trends in movie genres changed over the years on Netflix compared to MovieLens?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rationale**:\n",
    "- Similarities and Differences      \n",
    "Analyzing if Netflix prioritizes movies with high MovieLens ratings helps reveal if external ratings influence Netflix's content selection strategy and the alignment of user preferences across platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "- User Behavior     \n",
    "Comparing rating distributions for movies on and off Netflix can show if Netflix curates higher-rated content or focuses on other factors like licensing or trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Movie and User Trends \n",
    "Examining genre trends over time on Netflix and MovieLens highlights changing user preferences and platform strategies, offering insights into evolving movie consumption patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Approach**:\n",
    "- Data Linking: Use common columns (movieId, imdbId, title) to link MovieLens and Netflix.\n",
    "- Data Classification and Processing: Create the necessary data groups (movies on Netflix, movies not on Netflix, by year, genre).\n",
    "- Calculation and Analysis: Compute averages, distributions, and necessary statistics.\n",
    "- Visualization: Use charts to illustrate results and trends.\n",
    "- Compare Results: Answer the research questions based on data analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Significance**:       \n",
    "These research questions aim to better understand how user ratings, genre trends, and content availability influence viewing habits, and they offer valuable insights for streaming services, movie recommendations, and content curation strategies."

    "\n",
    "### Analysis of Research Question 1:\n",
    "**Does Netflix prioritize movies with high ratings on MovieLens?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Observations:**  \n",
    "The average MovieLens rating for movies available on Netflix (~3.5) is slightly higher than for those not available on Netflix (~3.0). Although the difference is small, it suggests that Netflix tends to include movies with higher ratings.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Conclusion:**  \n",
    "Netflix seems to prioritize higher-rated movies, potentially as part of its strategy to enhance user experience by offering well-received content.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Limitations:**  The difference in ratings (~0.5 points) is minor and might not be statistically significant.\n",
    "Other factors like genres, popularity, or licensing agreements may influence Netflix's choices.\n",
    "Imbalance in the number of movies in each group could skew the results.\n",
    "Further statistical testing and deeper analysis are recommended for stronger conclusions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analysis of Research Question 2:  \n",
    "**How do the rating distributions of MovieLens users differ for movies available on Netflix compared to those not available on Netflix?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Observations:**  \n",
    "  The density plot shows distinct differences in the rating distributions:  \n",
    "  - Movies **available on Netflix** (blue curve): Ratings are more evenly distributed, with a slight skew toward higher ratings. The curve suggests that movies on Netflix generally receive more favorable ratings.  \n",
    "  - Movies **not available on Netflix** (orange curve): The distribution is strongly concentrated around lower ratings (2–3 range). These movies tend to have lower ratings overall compared to those available on Netflix.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Insights:**  \n",
    "  Netflix appears to favor movies with a more balanced or positively skewed rating distribution, possibly to ensure a better content offering for its users.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Conclusion:**  \n",
    "  Movies on Netflix are more likely to have higher or more balanced ratings compared to those not on Netflix. This supports the idea that Netflix curates its library to include better-rated movies, aligning with user preferences.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Limitations:**  \n",
    "  - External factors like genre popularity, licensing availability, or temporal trends might affect this distribution.  \n",
    "  - The dataset might not capture all movies on Netflix or reflect the full diversity of MovieLens user ratings.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Further analysis could focus on genre-specific trends or compare Netflix-exclusive movies with general releases.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analysis of Research Question 3:\n",
    "**How have trends in movie genres changed over the years?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Observations:**  \n",
    "The scatter plot highlights the trends in movie genres over the years for movies available on Netflix.\n",
    "\n",
    "Genres represented: Drama (blue), Thriller (orange), and \"No genres listed\" (green).\n",
    "Year distribution: The data covers movies released between 2016 and 2019. However, there are very few data points, making it difficult to draw strong conclusions.\n",
    "Drama movies have 2 entries around 2016, while Thriller has only 1 movie in the same period. Movies without listed genres appear exclusively in 2019 with 2 entries.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Insights:**  \n",
    "The dataset suggests no significant trend in genre popularity due to the limited number of data points.\n",
    "A higher representation of movies without genre listings in 2019 may indicate gaps in metadata rather than a meaningful trend.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Conclusion:**  \n",
    "The chart provides limited evidence to evaluate changes in movie genre trends over the years. More data is required to identify clear patterns or shifts in genre representation on Netflix over time."
